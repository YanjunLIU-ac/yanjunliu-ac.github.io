I am a Ph.D. student from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang) and [Prof. Jiewen Lai](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-lai-jiewen). My research interests include the design and development of continuum robots, robotic control systems, human-robot interaction and their applications in surgical procedures. For inquiries or collaboration opportunities, you can contact me via email [lyj19990319@126.com](mailto:lyj19990319@126.com) or [yanjunliu@link.cuhk.edu.hk](mailto:yanjunliu@link.cuhk.edu.hk).
