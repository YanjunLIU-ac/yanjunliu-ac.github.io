I am a Ph.D. student from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang) and [Prof. Jiewen Lai](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-lai-jiewen). 

My researches focus on the intersection of soft robotics, medical robotics, human-robot interaction and robotic control systems. Specifically, I am interested in developing continuum robot-assisted surgical procedures in ENT, OB/GYN, urology etc. For inquiries or collaboration, you can contact me via email [yanjunliu at link.cuhk.edu.hk](mailto:yanjunliu@link.cuhk.edu.hk).
